<h3>MultiBit Classic Release 0.5.19 is now available</h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce the next <a href="/releases.html">MultiBit Classic release (0.5.19) is available for download.</a></p>

<p>This update includes the ability to adjust your transaction fees.</p>

<h4>Summary of fixes</h4>
<p>Here is a quick summary of the fixes contained in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjust your transaction fees using a fee slider (backported from MultiBit HD)</li>
  <li>Updated installer - no need to install a separate Java run time</li>
  <li>Stronger branding as MultiBit Classic to help distinguish it from our new wallet, MultiBit HD</li>
  <li>Link in header to make it easy for you to try MultiBit HD</li>
  <li>Various bug fixes and small user interface tidy ups</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjustable fees</h4>
<p>MultiBit Classic previously had a fixed transaction fee rate of 0.0001 BTC/KB (10 satoshi/byte). Nowadays a more flexible fee rate is required to cope with
Bitcoin network stress tests etc. We have backported the MultiBit HD fee slider so that you can now adjust the transaction fee rate from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimum: 0.00001 BTC/KB (1 satoshi/byte)</li>
  <li>Maximum: 0.0005 BTC/KB (50 satoshi/byte)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can adjust the fee rate with your mouse or the left and right arrows for fine adjustment.</p>
