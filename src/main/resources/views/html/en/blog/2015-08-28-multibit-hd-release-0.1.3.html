<h4>Temporarily dropping Tor support</h4>
<p>It is with regret that we have had to pull Tor support from the wallet temporarily. This is due to a number of error reports that we received indicating problems out in the field
  and our own experiences attempting to use Tor on a variety of networks.</p>

<p>Our Tor support comes from the Orchid library fork integrated with the excellent Bitcoinj library and was presented under our Labs section as an experimental feature while we tried it out
  on a larger user base. Unfortunately there are some problems with it right now that prevent it from working reliably enough to continue. Consequently we have decided to switch it off while we work with the Orchid/Bitcoinj team to resolve the issues so it can be reinstated in a later release.</p>

<h4>Semi-automatic update</h4>

<p>We normally wait 24 hours after a release and then activate the semi-automatic upgrade process. You decide if the upgrade occurs. The upgrade process will not affect your wallet data. Only the application binaries will be upgraded.</p><p>Note that MultiBit HD 0.1.2 did not have the upgrade process enabled so you will have to download the installer directly from our download page.</p>

<p>You can find more details, including digital signatures, on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.</p>
