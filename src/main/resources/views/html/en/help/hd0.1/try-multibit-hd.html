<h3>Try MultiBit HD</h3>

<p>Thank you being a MultiBit Classic user and for taking the time to find out more about MultiBit HD. We'd like to take this chance to tell you about why we think upgrading
  to MultiBit HD is the right thing to do, but also to emphasise that you are under no pressure to do so.</p>

<p>Here is a link to <a href="how-to-upgrade-from-classic.html">go straight to the upgrade instructions</a> if you have already made up your mind.</p>

<h4>Why did you create MultiBit HD ?</h4>

<p>To fully answer that you will need some background. MultiBit Classic is a first generation Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Bitcoin wallet. When it was first introduced
  back in 2011 it enabled people to use Bitcoin much more easily than they could before due to the much lighter network load it required.</p>

<p>At that time the concept of hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets was unknown and all Bitcoin wallets relied on random private keys. In order to simplify matters for
  non-technical people these private keys were re-used resulting in a weakened security model but having the advantage of allowing for more reliable data recovery if something went
  wrong with a user's computer.</p>

<p>With the introduction of HD through the Bitcoin Improvement Process (BIP) it became possible for different Bitcoin wallets to be able to share a common piece of data, the
  "wallet words" or "seed phrase", from which an enormous number of fresh private keys could be generated. This greatly simplified the problem of safely storing user's private
  keys.</p>

<p>When we looked at adding HD technology to MultiBit Classic we realised that it would take a tremendous amount of work to implement. While this work was going on there would
  be a lot of potential side effects that could cause problems and a lot of upgrades for our users to go through. After careful consideration we decided it was in the best
  interests of everyone concerned to create a new Bitcoin wallet.</p>

<p>MultiBit Classic is free but MultiBit HD is not - is that true ?</p>

<p>Yes. When we designed MultiBit HD we included a fee mechanism that adds 1,000 satoshi to each spend that you make. This is about 0.5 US cents at 1 BTC=500 USD so it would
  take about 800 sends to reach a single New York latte.</p>

<h4>That seems very low... is it enough ?</h4>

<p>We believe so. Setting the fee so low allows MultiBit HD to be affordable to most people in the world. As more people use it then we can gather more income which will
  allow us to do more for the Bitcoin ecosystem (feed income upstream, employ developers etc). We hope that this will become a virtuous circle.</p>

<h4>Can MultiBit HD and Classic run together on the same machine ?</h4>

<p>Yes. MultiBit HD has been designed to be completely separate from Classic. They can both safely operate on the same machine without interfering with each other.</p>

<h4>Is there a free trial option ?</h4>

<p>No. However, you can do a lot of exploring in MultiBit HD without having to have any bitcoin present on it. If you like it you can make the decision
  to slow spend into your MultiBit HD wallet until you have made the transition in a manner comfortable to you.</p>

<h4>Is there a compelling reason to upgrade ?</h4>

<p>There are 2 principal reasons but they are not so much compelling as concerning:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Slower upgrade cycle than MultiBit HD - security fixes may take longer</li>
  <li>Long term effect of address re-use - quantum computing may break exposed public keys</li>
</ol>

<h4>What if I don't upgrade ?</h4>

<p>That is entirely your choice. We are committed to maintaining MultiBit Classic so that it is kept up to date with security and network issues.</p>

<p>However, we will not be putting in exciting new features since they are reserved for MultiBit HD. Over time you may find that certain add-ons to Bitcoin, such as Payment
  Protocol, become more prevalent and are not supported in MultiBit Classic. It is similar to sticking with Internet Explorer 1.0 which can still show basic web pages, but missing
  out on all the fun stuff happening with the latest
  version.</p>

<h4>OK I'll try it. Where do I start ?</h4>

<p>At the <a href="/">front page</a>. Just read and accept the terms and conditions (they tell you about the fee) then click the button corresponding to
  your operating system. After a moment the download will begin and some installation instructions will appear.</p>
