<h2>BlockStoreException</h2>
<p>You see a BlockStoreException very occasionally when MultiBit Classic starts. It prevents you synchronising with the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>You can fix this problem by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Find where MultiBit Classic is storing your user data - see the help topic <a href="help_troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a></p></li>
<li><p>Shut down MultiBit Classic</p></li>
<li><p>Go to your MultiBit Classic user data directory - worked out in step 1 - and delete the file multibit.spvchain</p></li>
<li><p>Start up MultiBit Classic again</p></li>
</ol>
It will then regenerate this file and start syncing.
After it has synced you should see all your bitcoin in your wallet..
