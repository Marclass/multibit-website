<h2>Installing on OS X Mountain Lion</h2>
<p>Before installing on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, you need to change your machine's default security settings. This is because MultiBit Classic DMG files are not currently signed with
  an Apple Developer key. Earlier Mac OS X operating systems are not affected.</p>
<p>The setting to change is in the 'Apple menu > "System Preferences..." > "Personal" section > "Security & Privacy" > "General" pane'. The setting to set is the 'Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere'. Here is a screenshot:</p>

<p>Without this setup, when you try to open the DMG file you get an error:</p><p>"MultiBit Classic” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should eject the disk image.</p>
<p>In due course we will start signing the MultiBit Classic DMG files and this problem will disappear.</p>
