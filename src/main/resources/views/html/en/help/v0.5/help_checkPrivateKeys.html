<h2>Check private keys</h2>
<p>You can use this option to cross check your wallet's private keys to the wallet's receiving addresses. This checks the internal consistency of your wallet.</p>
<p>To check the private keys of a wallet, do the following:</p>

<h3>1. Select the wallet</h3>
<p>In the "<img width="16" height="16" title="Wallets" alt="Wallets" src="/images/en/v0_5/yourWallets.png"/>&nbsp;Wallets"
  side panel choose the wallet for which you want to check the private keys.</p>

<h3>2. Activate the private key checking tool</h3>
<p>Select the menu option "Tools | <img width="16" height="16" title="Check private keys"
                                        alt="Check private keys" src="/images/en/v0_5/checkKey.png"/>&nbsp;Check
  Private Keys". The "<img width="16" height="16" title="Check private keys" alt="Check private keys"
                           src="/images/en/v0_5/checkKey.png"/>&nbsp;Check Private Keys" screen appears.</p></p>

<p>It will appear similar to this:</p>

<p><img width="762" height="397" title="Check private keys" alt="Check private keys"
        src="/images/en/v0_5/checkPrivateKeys.png"/></p>

<h3>3. Fill in the password</h3>
<p>If the wallet is password protected, enter the password in the "Wallet password" field.</p>
<p>To check the private keys for the wallet specified, click on the button "<img width="16" height="16"
                                                                                 title="Check private keys"
                                                                                 alt="Check private keys"
                                                                                 src="/images/en/v0_5/checkKey.png"/>&nbsp;Check
  private keys". A message will appear upon completion.</p>

<h3>4. Examine the results</h3>
<p>If the check was successful your wallet is internally consistent and there is nothing more for you to do.</p>

<p>If the check was unsuccessful a note will appear telling you to read the Messages tab. In the Messages tab are
  details of which addresses do not have the correct private keys. You should <strong>not</strong> send any bitcoin
  to these addresses as it will not be redeemable.</p>

<p>Any existing balance on the addresses specified can only be redeemed by recovering the private keys. You should
  search your MultiBit Classic and Blockchain.info backup wallets and private key exports to find these private keys. You
  can then <a href="/en/help/v0.5/help_importingPrivateKeys.html">import them into your wallet</a> of choice and
  recover your bitcoin.</p>

<p>If you have no copy of the relevant private keys in <strong>any</strong> backup then the bitcoin on these addresses will not be
  redeemable. At this point you should consider data recovery software if you think there is a chance that a deleted
  backup may contain a working private key.</p>

<p>If you have really, truly lost your private keys, then it is likely that you have lost access to your bitcoin.
  There is <strong>absolutely no way</strong> that the MultiBit team can possibly recover them.</p>

<p>You should keep the encrypted files safe just in case inspiration strikes. Never delete a wallet, just archive
  it safely.</p>
