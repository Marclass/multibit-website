<h2>Could not understand address in import file</h2>
<p>You see this message if you try to import private keys in a format that MultiBit Classic doesn't recognise.<p>
<p>You can fix this problem by putting the keys you want to import into the same format that MultiBit Classic uses to export keys - see <a href="help_exportingPrivateKeys.html#exportFileFormat">Export file format</a> or <a href="help_importASingleKey.html">How to import a single private key</a>.</p>
