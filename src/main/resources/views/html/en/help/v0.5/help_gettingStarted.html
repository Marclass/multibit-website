<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>MultiBit Classic is designed to be as easy to use as possible. It is intended for domestic (or small scale merchant) users who wish to use a desktop computer for their day to day
Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>This guide will provide you with the first steps you should take after you have installed MultiBit Classic so that you can be confident about how to get
things done safely.</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Password protect your wallet</h3>

wallet will not have a password so it will not be encrypted.</p>

For instance, it might say: "MultiBit Classic - My wallet - /Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit Classic/multibit.wallet". The file name at the end is where your wallet is stored.</p>
